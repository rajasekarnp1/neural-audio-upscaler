# Neural Audio Upscaler

An advanced neural network-based audio upscaling application that enhances the quality of audio files using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **Self-Adapting Content Analysis**: Automatically detects audio type (voice, music, ambient) and applies the most appropriate enhancement model
- **Specialized Neural Models**: Different models optimized for different audio types
- **High-Frequency Synthesis**: Intelligently generates missing high-frequency content
- **Phase-Aware Processing**: Preserves temporal coherence through proper phase handling
- **Quality Preservation**: Advanced preprocessing and postprocessing to maintain audio fidelity
- **Training Mode**: Models can be trained and fine-tuned on your own audio
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with clear progress feedback

## Research Background

This application is based on cutting-edge research in audio super-resolution and enhancement:

- WaveNet-based audio super-resolution techniques [Kuleshov et al., 2022]
- Content-adaptive bandwidth extension [Birnbaum et al., 2024]
- Phase-aware audio processing [Takamichi et al., 2023]
- Self-supervised learning for audio enhancement [Défossez et al., 2023]

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Click "Select Audio File" to choose an audio file to upscale
2. The application will automatically analyze the audio content
3. The upscaling process will begin, with progress shown in the terminal
4. Once complete, the enhanced audio will be saved to your chosen location

### Command Line Interface

Process an audio file using the command line:

```bash
# Basic usage
./upscale.sh input.wav output.wav

# With options
node cli.js --no-preprocessing --training-mode input.wav output.wav

# Show help
node cli.js --help
```

#### CLI Options

- `--no-preprocessing`: Disable audio preprocessing
- `--no-postprocessing`: Disable audio postprocessing
- `--training-mode`: Enable training mode (model will learn from this example)
- `--audio-type <type>`: Force audio type (voice, music, ambient, general)
- `--help`: Show help message

### Training Models

```bash
# Train models on a dataset
node train.js ./training_data

# With options
node train.js --epochs 20 --learning-rate 0.0005 ./training_data

# Show help
node train.js --help
```

#### Training Options

## Technical Details

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes audio to determine content type
2. **Preprocessing**: Prepares audio for neural enhancement with dynamic range normalization, noise reduction, etc.
3. **Model Selection**: Selects the appropriate neural model based on content
4. **Frequency-Domain Processing**: Processes audio in the frequency domain for precise control
5. **High-Frequency Synthesis**: Generates missing high frequencies based on content type
6. **Phase Reconstruction**: Preserves and reconstructs phase information for natural sound
7. **Postprocessing**: Applies final enhancements to preserve original character and quality

### Neural Models

- **Voice Model**: Optimized for speech characteristics and formants
- **Music Model**: Preserves harmonic structure and musical details
- **Ambient Model**: Enhances environmental sounds while preserving natural characteristics
- **General Model**: Balanced approach for mixed content

### Quality Preservation Techniques

- **Bit Depth Preservation**: Maintains or increases bit depth during processing
- **Dithering**: Applied during format conversion to minimize quantization errors
- **Original Character Preservation**: Subtle mixing of original characteristics
- **Transient Preservation**: Special handling of attack transients
- **Harmonic Enhancement**: Careful enhancement of harmonic content

### Training Capabilities

- **Self-Adapting Models**: Models learn from new examples in training mode
- **Dataset Training**: Train on your own dataset of low/high quality pairs
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust existing models for specific audio types
- **Continuous Learning**: Models improve over time with more examples
