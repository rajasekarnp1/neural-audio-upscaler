# Neural Audio Upscaler - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements an advanced neural network-based audio upscaling application that enhances audio quality while preserving the original character of the sound. The application uses specialized neural models for different audio types (voice, music, ambient) and includes a training mode for continuous improvement.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Self-Adapting Content Analysis**: Automatically detects audio type and applies the appropriate enhancement model
2. **Specialized Neural Models**: Different models optimized for different audio types
3. **Quality Preservation**: Advanced preprocessing and postprocessing to maintain audio fidelity
4. **Training Mode**: Models can be trained and fine-tuned on your own audio
5. **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line, desktop application, and web interface
6. **Phase-Aware Processing**: Preserves temporal coherence through proper phase handling

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- **AudioUpscaler**: Main class that orchestrates the upscaling process
- **ContentAnalyzer**: Analyzes audio to determine content type
- **Spectrogram**: Handles frequency domain processing
- **PhaseReconstructor**: Preserves phase information for natural sound
- **AudioPreprocessor**: Prepares audio for neural enhancement
- **AudioPostprocessor**: Applies final enhancements to preserve original character
- **ModelTrainer**: Handles model training and fine-tuning

### Interfaces

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Basic usage: `node cli.js input.wav output.wav`
   - Advanced options: `--training-mode`, `--no-preprocessing`, etc.
   - Shell script wrapper: `./upscale.sh`

2. **Web Interface**
   - Start with: `./start-web.sh`
   - Access at: `http://localhost:12000`
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Progress visualization

3. **Desktop Application**
   - Built with Electron
   - Start with: `npm start`
   - Similar interface to web version

### Neural Models

- **Voice Model**: Optimized for speech characteristics and formants
- **Music Model**: Preserves harmonic structure and musical details
- **Ambient Model**: Enhances environmental sounds while preserving natural characteristics
- **General Model**: Balanced approach for mixed content

### Quality Preservation Techniques

- **Bit Depth Preservation**: Maintains or increases bit depth during processing
- **Original Character Preservation**: Subtle mixing of original characteristics
- **Transient Preservation**: Special handling of attack transients
- **Harmonic Enhancement**: Careful enhancement of harmonic content

### Training Capabilities

- **Self-Adapting Models**: Models learn from new examples in training mode
- **Dataset Training**: Train on your own dataset of low/high quality pairs
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust existing models for specific audio types
- **Continuous Learning**: Models improve over time with more examples

## Usage Examples

### Basic Upscaling

```bash
node cli.js input.mp3 output.wav
```

### Training Mode

```bash
node cli.js --training-mode input.mp3 output.wav
```

### Web Interface

2. Open browser at `http://localhost:12000`
3. Upload audio file
4. Download enhanced audio

## Future Improvements

1. **Real Model Training**: Implement actual model training with TensorFlow.js
2. **More Audio Formats**: Add support for additional audio formats
3. **Batch Processing**: Add support for processing multiple files at once
4. **Advanced Visualization**: Add waveform and spectrogram visualization
5. **User Presets**: Allow users to save and load processing presets
