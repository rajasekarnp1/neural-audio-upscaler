# Project Promemory: Neural Audio Upscaler Enhancement

## Cycle 0: Initial Analysis and Re-Planning

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Overall Goal:** To significantly refactor and enhance the 'Neural Audio Upscaler' project by correctly implementing its existing (placeholder) neural network pipeline, exploring alternative audio upscaling techniques, cross-mixing research and techniques, and iteratively improving the codebase over multiple cycles. The primary focus for rework is the core audio processing logic.

**Decisions Leading to Current Plan (Cycle 1):**
- User request for a deep re-evaluation, iterative improvement (3 cycles), and exploration beyond the initial NN focus.
- Clarification that the existing NN should be implemented correctly as a baseline, while also researching and considering other methods.
- Agreement to focus on core audio logic first.
- Decision to establish formal Knowledge Management (`PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`) and Project Memory (`PROJECT_PROMEMORY.md`) files.

**Current Stage:** Beginning Cycle 1, Step 1: Establish Knowledge Management & Project Memory Files.

**Cycle 1, Step 1: Establish Knowledge Management & Project Memory Files - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Created `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with initial sections for project overview, NN implementation details, alternative techniques, design decisions, open questions, and glossary.
- Created `PROJECT_PROMEMORY.md` with initial entry covering overall goals and decisions leading to Cycle 1 plan.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 2: Rectify `Spectrogram.js` Implementation.

**Cycle 1, Step 2: Rectify `Spectrogram.js` Implementation - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Modified `src/spectrogram.js` to replace placeholder FFT/IFFT logic with functional implementations using the `fft.js` library.
- Ensured `performFFT` processes real signals and outputs separate real/imaginary spectral components.
- Ensured `performInverseFFT` takes real/imaginary spectral components and produces a real time-domain signal, including necessary normalization.
- Updated `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with details of this implementation.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 3: Implement `ContentAnalyzer.js` Functionality.

**Cycle 1, Step 3: Implement `ContentAnalyzer.js` Functionality - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Modified `src/contentAnalyzer.js` to replace placeholder analysis logic.
- Implemented WAV file reading and feature extraction (simplified: averaged first 40 spectrogram bins).
- Integrated the TensorFlow.js model for prediction, deriving confidence scores and dominant audio type.
- Updated `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with details, noting the preliminary nature of the current feature extraction.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 4: Implement Core Upscaling Logic in `AudioUpscaler.processAudio`.

**Cycle 1, Step 4: Implement Core Upscaling Logic in `AudioUpscaler.processAudio` - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Significantly refactored `AudioUpscaler.js`:
    - `processAudio` now implements time-domain audio processing using segmentation and TensorFlow.js model prediction on audio samples, aligning with the `conv1d` model architecture. Output uses simplified segment concatenation.
    - `readAudioFile` updated to use `wavefile` for robust WAV parsing, returning detailed audio info, and includes an ffmpeg fallback for non-standard WAVs.
    - `saveAudioFile` updated to use `wavefile` for constructing WAV files from processed samples.
- Updated `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with these implementation details, noting current assumptions (model output length, simplified OLA) and the non-use of Spectrogram/PhaseReconstructor modules for these specific models.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 5: Review and Refine Audio File I/O (already largely addressed, will be a quick review).

---

**Cycle 1, Step 5: Review and Refine Audio File I/O - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Reviewed the `readAudioFile` and `saveAudioFile` methods in `AudioUpscaler.js` after their significant refactoring in Step 4.
- Confirmed that the integration of the `wavefile` library and the `ffmpeg` fallback in `readAudioFile` have substantially improved I/O robustness.
- No immediate further refinements were deemed critical for Cycle 1. Potential minor improvements (e.g., alternative handling for 24-bit depth output) can be deferred.
- No code changes were made in this step.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 6: Basic Unit Tests for Core Components.

---

**Cycle 1, Step 6: Basic Unit Tests for Core Components - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Modified `test.js` to serve as a basic automated test suite.
- Implemented test cases for:
    - `Spectrogram.js`: STFT/ISTFT round-trip signal integrity.
    - `ContentAnalyzer.js`: Successful execution and valid output structure using real audio files.
    - `AudioUpscaler.js` (the real version): Successful execution, progress reporting, and valid mono WAV output.
- The tests use `console.assert` for verifications.
- Updated `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with the testing strategy.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 7: Identify and Document Alternative Upscaling Techniques (Start of Phase 3).

---

**Cycle 1, Step 7: Identify and Document Alternative Upscaling Techniques - COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Summary:**
- Populated Section 3 ("Alternative Audio Upscaling Techniques") in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`.
- Added subsections with detailed descriptions (Basic Principle, Pros, Cons, Key Components, Complementation with existing NN) for:
    - 3.1 Classical DSP: Windowed Sinc Interpolation & Spectral Reshaping
    - 3.2 Machine Learning: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Audio Super-Resolution
    - 3.3 Machine Learning: Autoencoders for Audio Denoising & Enhancement (adapted for Upscaling)
- This step completes the initial documentation phase for alternative techniques.

**Next Step:** Cycle 1, Step 8: Initial Comparative Discussion in Knowledge Base.

**Cycle 1, Step 8: Initial Comparative Discussion in Knowledge Base - IN PROGRESS**

**Date:** 2024-07-24

**Goal:** Add initial thoughts on comparing these techniques and potential hybrid concepts to Section 4 of `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`.
